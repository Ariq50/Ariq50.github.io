   <h2> Explanation of AJAX </h2>
  <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It is a technique for creating dynamic and interactive web pages without reloading them. 
  AJAX allows web pages to communicate with web servers in the background, and update parts of the page as needed.</p> 
  <p>The JavaScript code in the .html file uses the XMLHttpRequest object to send and receive data from a web server. 
    The XMLHttpRequest object is a built-in feature of most browsers that enables asynchronous communication between the client and the server. 
    The code also uses jQuery, a popular JavaScript library that simplifies many tasks such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX requests.</p> 
  <p>The code has two main parts: one for sending data to the server, and one for receiving data from the server. 
    The first part is inside a function called loadDoc(), which is triggered by clicking a button with id=“btn”. 
    The second part is inside another function called loadDoc2(), which is also triggered by clicking another button with id=“btn2”.</p> 
  <p>The first function, loadDoc(), sends an HTTP GET request to a file called ajax_info.txt, which contains some information about AJAX. 
    The request is sent using the open() method of the XMLHttpRequest object, which specifies the URL, method, and whether it is asynchronous or not. 
    The request is then sent using the send() method of the XMLHttpRequest object.</p> <p>The second function, loadDoc2(), 
      does not send any request to the server, but instead displays some information about AJAX on the page using jQuery. 
      It uses the jQuery.get() method to fetch data from an external source using Ajax. 
      The get() method takes two parameters: a URL and a callback function that will be executed when the data is received. 
      The callback function uses jQuery.text() to get all text content from an element with id=“demo” and display it on the page.</p> 
  <p>By using these two functions, you can see how AJAX works in action. When you click either button, 
    you will see some information about AJAX appear on your page without reloading it. 
    You can also try changing or adding some text in either file (ajax_info.txt or ajax_data.txt) and see how it affects your page.</p>
  <h3>REST API</h3> <p>A REST API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). 
    REST APIs allow developers to access and manipulate data on a server using standard HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 
    REST APIs are widely used for web development, as they enable interoperability and scalability of applications across different platforms and devices.</p> 
  <p>One of the most popular and useful REST APIs is the Google Maps Platform API1, which provides access to Google’s mapping services, such as geocoding, directions, places, street view, and more. 
    The Google Maps Platform API allows developers to embed interactive maps on their websites or applications, customize the map appearance and functionality, and integrate with other Google products and services.</p> 
  <p>The Google Maps Platform API uses JSON as the response file format2, which is a lightweight and human-readable data interchange format. 
    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and it consists of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. 
    JSON files can be easily parsed and manipulated by various programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, etc.</p> 
  <p>To use the Google Maps Platform API, developers need to create a project on the Google Cloud Console and enable the APIs they want to use. 
      Developers also need to obtain an API key3, which is a unique identifier that authenticates their requests to the API. 
    The API key is not publicly available and should be kept secure. 
    Developers can set limits on how many requests they can make per day or per month using quotas4, which are enforced by the Google Cloud Platform.</p> 
  <p>The documentation for the Google Maps Platform API can be found on the [official website], where developers can learn more about the features, parameters, examples, best practices, and troubleshooting tips for using the API. 
    The documentation also provides links to other resources, such as tutorials, videos, blogs, forums, etc., that can help developers get started or solve common issues with the API.</p>
